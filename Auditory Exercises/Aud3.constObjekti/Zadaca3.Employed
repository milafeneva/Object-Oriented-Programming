Write a Datum class that stores day, month, and year (integers).
Write a Vraboten class that stores the employee's name (no more than 20 characters), salary, and date of birth (an object of the Datum class).
Write two functions that take an array of employees and the size of the array as arguments.
One function returns the employee with the highest salary, and the other function returns the youngest employee in the company.
In the main program, it is necessary to print the data for the youngest and highest paid employee on the screen. 
Printing the employee should be implemented with a special function print() within the Vraboten class.
